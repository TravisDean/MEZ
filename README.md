# MEZ
Music Visualizations in 3D Space 

Mez is a spectrogram-based audio analysis and visualization tool, designed for rendering complex, non-chaotic scenes that react to music in an intelligent way.

It's controllable through MIDI interfaces as well as Leap Motion controllers. Originally MEZ was designed to render VR scenes, but it evolved into a tool used for live VJ performances. To support this, output is Spouted to a render texture and controls function when the app is backgrounded.

The version here is an archive before I took the source code private. Videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC89VfbWlYyqqMBXKOGGBBmw) are probably from a different version.
